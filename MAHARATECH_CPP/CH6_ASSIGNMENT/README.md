<li>private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class</li>

<h2>Function Overriding:</h2>
<p>Function overriding in C++ is a concept by which you can define a function of the same name and the same function signature (parameters and their data types) in both the base class and derived class with a different function definition.</p>

<h2>Multi Level Inheritance:</h2>
<p>In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class and that derived class can be derived from a base class or any other derived class. There can be any number of levels.</p>
